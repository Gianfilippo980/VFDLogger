# VFDLogger
This Project started with the aim of logging ambient parameters (Temperature, Pressure and Relative Humidity) in my university. Given that it was made by me, most of the project now is about the use of VFDs and of a GPS.
The project logs the data to a microSD and to serial output via USB, displays both data and time on VFDs.
